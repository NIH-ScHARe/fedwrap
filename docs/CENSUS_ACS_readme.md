üß≠ **Overivew** 

A Python wrapper for the U.S. Census Bureau‚Äôs American Community Survey (ACS) API. Simplifies fetching ACS datasets such as population, housing, income, and education.

üõ†Ô∏è **Installation** 

```bash
pip install fedwrap
```

üìù **Instructions**

Calls to the census_acs occurs through functions for each variable in the ACS dataset. The basic structure of a call is: 

```python
get_acs_data(MEASUREID,YEAR,GEO,as_percent)
```
**Years**

The years of the American Communities Survey accessible by API range from 2009 - 2023. 

**Geography**

The following geographical gradations are supported:
- state
- county
- census tract
- zip code
- congressional district 

**Absolute values versus percentage**

The census_acs wrapper is designed to return either absolute values or relative percentages for all variables. The default is absolute, as would be returned by: 

```python
get_acs_data('TOTAL_POP','2023','state')
```

To get the relative amounts for the values of any variable, set the 'as_percent' parameter to True: 

```python
get_acs_data('TOTAL_POP','2023','state',as_percent=True)
```
